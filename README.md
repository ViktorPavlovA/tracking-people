# Tracking people in real-time



- I used opnecv and numpy with out any CNN architecture.
- Ð¡lassifier was `HOGDescriptor`

## **TO DO LIST**

- Need to do filter function - `done`
- ~~maybe try to train `yolo CNN` in black and white pictures, also maybe make a shot in way of `k-means` picture,because where are a lot differnet reflections of people.~~
- ~~by the way, also we can collecte the points of middle boxes and also predict with using `NN with LSTM `. Hello Pytorch.~~
- ~~also  need try segmentation CNN like Unet, but first need to do is make more than 12 mask. After it should make augmentation.~~ I used pytorch for segmentation, but `HOGDescriptor` couldn't find man on img then he was far from camera. **Py script located in test_torch folder**

## how it looks like right now
